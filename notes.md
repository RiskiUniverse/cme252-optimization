# todo
- maybe open class with regression to see CVXPY examples
    - students won't know convexity at this point
    - but this gives us more examples to work with when
      explaining convex functions, sets, problems in lecture 2
- with regression, can explain multiobjective problems
- give examples with convex problem transformations

# homework
- given list of spheres (point in R^n and radius), find a point in the intersection
- find a point in intersection furthest in x direction
- intersection of "diamonds" l1-ball?
- ooh: list of norm balls: center, norm, raidus. find intersection
- polytopes: (need to introduce convex hull of points) given vertices of 2 convex polyhedra, determine if they intersect.
- hyperplane version of polytope?

## diet problem
- list of foods with nutrients
- min and max healthy range for each nutrient
- find a healthy diet
